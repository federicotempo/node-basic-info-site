# node-basic-info-site
 This project is a basic informational website built with Node.js as part of a practical exercise to apply foundational knowledge. The site includes the following pages:

1. Index: A homepage with a brief introduction.
2. About: A general information page.
3. Contact Me: A contact page with a simple form or placeholder contact details.
4. 404: A custom error page for handling non-existent routes.
The focus of the project is on development and logical structure rather than detailed content or design.
